This is a C++ program that reads data from the A1input.txt file and inserted into a one dimensional array and performs exactly four functions of printing the array, searching through the array, adding and element to the end of the array, deleting or replacing an element in the array to zero, and modify the elements in the array. 

Once the user runs the code, it will print a message to ensure that the compiler has read the input file (A1input.txt file) and will then display a menu of options the user can choose when deciding what to do with the current array. The options and what they do will is according to the following: 

**NOTE: After each option, array will display to show any changes done to it. **

**Option A:** User enters A in the prompt and it will print what the current array looks like.

**Option B:** User enters B in the prompt and it will then prompt the user to enter a value in the array they would like to search. It will then verify if the value is in the array and it will display the index of where that value is at in the array.
